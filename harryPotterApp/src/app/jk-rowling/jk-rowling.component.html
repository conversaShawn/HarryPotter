            Joanne Rowling (born 31 July 1965), better known by her
            pen names J. K. Rowling and Robert Galbraith, is a British novelist, screenwriter, producer, and
            philanthropist. She is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards
            and sold more than 500 million copies, becoming the best-selling book series in history. The Harry
            Potter books have also been the basis for the popular film series of the same name, over which Rowling had
            overall approval on the scripts and was a producer on the final films.
            <br>
            <br>
            Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty
            International when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from
            Manchester to London in 1990. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of
            her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series,
            Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last,
            Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written five books for
            adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and—under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction Cormoran
            Strike series, which consists of The Cuckoo's Calling (2013), The Silkworm (2014), Career of Evil (2015),
            and Lethal White (2018).

            Rowling has lived a "rags to riches" life in which she progressed from living on benefits to being the
            world's first billionaire author. She lost her billionaire status after giving away much of her earnings
            to charity, but remains one of the wealthiest people in the world. She is the UK's best-selling living
            author, with sales in excess of £238 million. The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's
            fortune at £600 million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK. Time named her a
            runner-up for its 2007 Person of the Year, noting the social, moral, and political inspiration she has given
            her fans. In October 2010, Rowling was named the "Most Influential Woman in Britain" by leading magazine
            editors. She has supported multiple charities, including <a class="jkCharity"
